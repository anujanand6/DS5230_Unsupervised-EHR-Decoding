# DS5230_Unsupervised-EHR-Decoding

In order to find patients with appropriate characteristics for a clinical trial, medical professionals have to examine clinical records for each candidate patient, one at a time. Each clinical trial has certain selection criteria that a patient must meet in order to be accepted. This criteria - such as having a major diabetes-related complication, or advanced cardiovascular disease, can be found in the patientâ€™s health record. However, this information is not easily discernible without reading through the whole record.

The dataset we will be analyzing has patient records as well as clinical trial criteria tags, which were created by two annotators with medical expertise. Automatically identifying selection criteria from these electronic health records (EHR) has already been accomplished using supervised learning methods. 

This project hopes to speed up the computation and increase the accuracy of automated criteria identification through extracting text features and clustering the records based on these identified features. In addition, we hope that through the interpretation of various features of clusters, we can provide additional useful information to medical professionals about these patients.
